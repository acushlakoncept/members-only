# Members Only Rails Application

In this project, we built an exclusive clubhouse app where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

 

 <!-- members :
    name, email, password, member-status

posts :
    title, body, member_id 
    
    add member_status to devise member table and set default to true
    create views
